## Description

GCD is one of the basic concept used in Cryptography. As per Wikipedia:

> the greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as greatest common factor (GCF),
> of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer
> that divides each of the integers. For two integers x, y, the greatest common
> divisor of x and y is denoted `gcd(x, y)`. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4, that is, gcd(8, 12) = 4

It can be calculated by using `Euclidean Algorithm`:

> The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor
> of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference
> with the smaller number. For example, 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 (as 252 = 21 × 12
> and 105 = 21 × 5), and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and 252 − 105 = 147

## Implementation in Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

def gcd(a, b):
  if a == b:
    return a
  if a < b:
    a, b = b, a
  return gcd(b, a-b)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  import sys

  val1 = int(input('Enter first number: ').strip())
  val2 = int(input('Enter second number: ').strip())
  print(f"GCD of {val1}, {val2}: {gcd(val1, val2)}")
```
